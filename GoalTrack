Project Name: Goal Tracker App

Description:
This Goal Tracker App is a small, self-developed project aimed at improving my skills in Python, SQL, and GUI development using tkinter.
It serves as a practical demonstration of my proficiency in these technologies and showcases my ability to create functional, user-friendly applications.

Key Features:

Goal Management: Create, update, and delete your goals easily.
Database Integration: Utilizes SQL to store and manage goal data efficiently.
User-Friendly GUI: The tkinter-based graphical user interface ensures a smooth and intuitive user experience.
Progress Tracking: Keep track of your goals' progress and completion status.
Learned Skills: Gain insight into my SQL database and Python programming abilities.
Learning Objectives:

Deepened understanding of SQL databases.
Enhanced Python programming skills.
Proficiency in developing GUI applications using tkinter.
Practical experience in project planning and development.

Project Status:
This project was created exclusively for learning purposes. While it has served its intended educational goals, it may not undergo further development or enhancements.
Your feedback and contributions, though appreciated, may not be actively solicited for this particular project..

Screenshots:
(Include screenshots of your application to provide a visual representation.)

How to Run:
To use the application without errors, you should first use the provided Python program to create the database and its respective tables.
Please note that you will need an SQL server like XAMPP for this process.
The program includes an option to add three goals and some tasks to the database, making it easier to visualize how the application functions

Future Enhancements:
(I'm not sure if im going to revisit this project since it was just for learning purposes)
